Data Model

3 collections, somewhat normalizing the relationship between clients and physios

    -clients
        - personal details
            -embedded address
            -embedded additional info
    
    -physios
        -personal details
            -embedded address

    -sessions
        -session details
        -session references id of client and physio

This NoSql data model was chosen because the clients and physios are seperate entities that are only related through sessions
A client and a physio may have many sessions, but each session only contains 1 client and 1 physio, referenceing each of there
_id's within the session document reduces file size if the db were to grow, vs the denormalized option of embedding sessions in 
client or physio documents or embedding physio/client docs in sessions.
